This way, the penis grows in size and width, and the erections last longer, which means you could satisfy your partner up to 5 times in a row.</strong></p>

Additionally, this discovery is supported by independent tests and clinical and lab trials, among others.</p>

                <p>Dr.Oz explained why his formula to enlarge the penis works so fast:</p>


                <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
                    "The secret of the formula effectiveness lies in its composition. It is a unique blend of substances that enlarge the cavernous bodies of the penis, thus increasing its size. At the same time, it also increases testosterone levels to 9.7 ng (nanograms per blood mililiter).</p>

                <p class="margin0">The key components of this formula are mint extract, arctium extract and guarana - these are natural ingredients that improve libido and blood circulation, but, most important of all, they also increase the size of the penis.</p>

                <p class="margin0">
                    These substances help to bring more blood to the penis and nourish its muscle tissue, which, in turn, have several results:</p>


                <p><strong>First of all</strong>, they immediately stimulate penis growth, as well as increase libido and testosterone levels. <strong>Likewise</strong>, it is important to note that, from a medical point of view, no one is able to reach the full potential of the corpora cavernosa if you do not consume these substances. It is the only method known to increase your penis to its maximum possible natural size. If the penis starts to receive more blood, the tissue will in turn begin to swell and to enlarge its size up to 2.5 inches.</p>

                <p><strong>Finally</strong>, these ingredients supplement metabolites deficit and clean the veins of toxins, which means the veins can transport the blood faster and better. That is why the penis increases its size and erections improve. The average time of sexual intercourse is 32 minutes.</p>

                <p>The synergy of these three stages allows penis growth and prolongs the duration of erections. Thanks to all of the mentioned above, you will not only have a 73.4% longer penis, but you will also enjoy more intense sex and are going to be able to give your partner up to 5 orgasms, since your penis will be bigger and will endure more."</p>

                <h3>Warning: Rely only on proven methods.</h3>

                <div class="cover_container">
                    <a href="{offer_link}" target="_blank"><img src="./index_files/cover.jpg"></a>
                    <p>The World of Science Magazine considered that the professor's method is the greatest discovery in the health field of the year 2019.</p>
                </div>
                <p>There are no coincidences in science, and neither are promises accepted. All that counts is the results of the medical trials. For this reason, Dr.Oz elaborated a special clinical analysis to verify that two hours are enough to enlarge the penis the first 0.3 - 0.5 inches.</p>
                <p>Researchers tested the treatment in a group of 122 men between the ages of 18 and 45 years old. Participants performed this method daily and described it as immediate and non-invasive. The idea of the trial was to scientifically test whether the penis enlargement formula created by Dr.Oz actually worked and ensured that the penis grew and the erections would last longer. These were the results:</p>
                <h3>The results were recorded during Dr.Oz's 4-week treatment, and published in the Man Power medical journal, under Health &amp; Disease:</h3>

                <ul style="line-height: 150%" class="bokk">
                    <li>The questionnaires showed that participants increased the size of their penises by 6.4 inches on average in 30 days .
                    </li>
                    <li>The participants' blood tests showed that cavernous bodies increased their volume by at least 71.4% and that testosterone levels increased by 9 nanograms (the average man has a testosterone level of 2.2 to 3 nanograms).
                    </li>
                    <li>The tests showed an increase of the erection time of up to 47 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>The average penis size of participants after the experiment was 7.6 inches.</li>
                </ul>

                        <p class="testdiaryp">I joined the experiment to solve my little problem of 4.8 inches. Two hours after starting the treatment, I began to feel its results. My penis was tingling (but it did not hurt), and little by little it was growing. Two days later, it already measured 5.6 inches. I had to do absolutely nothing because it was completely automatic. 6 days later, I had gained one more inch. The result: 6.1 inches! I began to feel more confident and I slept with my roommate, who is always willing to do the dirty. In the end, she told me that no man had ever given her so many orgasms in half an hour.</p>

                        <p class="testdiaryp">I feel better than never. I have more energy in bed and I am not ashamed to take off my pants. It is certainly due to getting rid of the stress of having to deal with a small penis. I can screw for 20 or 30 minutes, my penis doesn't get soft and it has grown 1.2 inches more. My penis has grown, so far, up to 7.3 inches in 3 weeks, meaning 0.8 inches every week. Having a bigger penis and having sex for longer is amazing. Finally, I feel pleasure in doing it and I can satisfy the girl I'm with.</p>

Plus, I can keep my erection up even after I come. I went to a party and hooked up with a chick to see if everything was in order. She went crazy when she saw how hung I am! And later I had a great time listening to her coming. We went at it for 41 minutes, I gave her 5 orgasms and we tried almost every position. Now, finally, I know I can hook up with anyone I like and not have to worry about the size of my penis.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight:bold;">I was afraid of sex.</p>
                        <p>I was desperate, I was 29 years old and I had a 5-inches penis. Girls found me attractive, but when it came time to go to bed, I was a failure. The next day they pretended not to know me. Everything changed when I started using this method. I was barely half-way in and they were already moaning with pleasure. I was afraid that my neighbors would hear us because they were so loud. My penis grew to 7.8 inches and was thicker. In short, this product gave me back my self-esteem.</p>

Two weeks later, my penis had grown 1.1 inches. I'm ridiculously happy! And my wife too :) Also i wonder how it's easy: just take 2 capsules daily, it takes a maximum of 30 seconds!
